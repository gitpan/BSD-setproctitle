BSD-setproctitle version 0.01
=============================

This module provides a Perl interface to the "setproctitle",
"getprogname" and "setprogname" routines found in modern BSD variants.

The setprogname() function manipulates the name of the current
program. This name is used by the libc error-reporting routines to
produce consistent output. Depending on your OS setprogname might be
actually a no-op.

The setproctitle() function sets the process title that appears on the
ps(1) command output. An empty string (translated internally to a NULL
pointer) or a string starting with a dash might trigger special
behaviour - consult your systems manpage! While the C setproctitle(3)
routine is vulnerable to format string attacks, this implementation is
not.  Only a single string argument is allowed which is taken
literally.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module works together with a newer *BSD variant:
FreeBSD >= 4.4 should work.
NetBSD >= 1.6 should work.
All DragonFlyBSD releases should work.
A recent OpenBSD should work too.

Basically every OS having the aforementioned routines in the C library
should be fine.

If you have more specific information about supported BSD variants
please report to the author so this section can be updated!
